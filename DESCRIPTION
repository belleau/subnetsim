Description: This package uses bootstrapping to test the hypothesis that a specific 
    subnetwork has more interactions than randomly generated subnetworks 
    with the same number of nodes. Three measures of connectivity are validated: the number of 
    links starting from the nodes of the subnetwork, the number of nodes in the subnetwork including 
    all the first-degree neighbor nodes and the number of links in the subnetwork including all the 
    links of the first-degree neighbor nodes.
