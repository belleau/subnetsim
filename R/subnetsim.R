#' subnetsim: Permutation-Based Analysis
#'
#' This package does a permutation analysis, based on Monte Carlo sampling,
#' for testing the hypothesis that the number of observed linked inside
#' a subnetwork is significantly higher that the number obtained by a
#' stochastic effect with a subnetwork with the same number of node.
#'
#' This package tests if a subnetwork is more connected than a randomly
#' selected subnetwork with the same number of nodes. We validate three
#' measures of connectivity: the number of links starting from the nodes
#' of the subnetwork, the number of nodes plus the number of nodes
#' directly connected to the subnetwork and the number of links from nodes
#' of the subnetwork and the nodes directly connected to the subnetwork.
#' To test if the subnetwork is significantly more connected than connections
#' obtained by randomness, the package does a simulation analysis.
