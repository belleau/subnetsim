# subnetsim #

The **subnetsim** package implements a simulation analysis, based on bootstrapping, for testing the hypothesis that a selected subnetwork, which is part of a larger network, has more interactions than expected by randomness. To do so, subnetworks with the same number of nodes than the tested subnetwork are randomly generated by bootstrapping. Three measures of connectivity used to validate the hypothesis are: 

* the number of nodes in the subnetwork including all the first-degree neighbor nodes
* the number of links in the subnetwork including all the links of the first-degree neighbor nodes
* the number of links in the subnetwork
