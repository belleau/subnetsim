Description: This package uses random sampling to test the hypothesis that a specific 
    subnetwork is more connected than randomly selected subnetworks 
    with the same number of nodes. Three measures of connectivity are validated: the number of 
    links starting from the nodes of the subnetwork, the number of nodes plus the number of nodes
    directly connected to the subnetwork and the number of links from nodes of the subnetwork and 
    the nodes directly connected to the subnetwork.
